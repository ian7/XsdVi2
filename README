All the merit of this project is held by Václav Slavětínský and I would like to
give my sincere thanks to him for his great tool that really helped me out when
I wa stuck.
You can find here his original source code.

I only changed a bit the program so that it can suit my needs.
To use it just put the .xsd file as the first argument in CLI.

    XsdVi has been originally developped by Václav Slavětínský and then
    slightly modified by Malik Olivier Boussejra. It allows to draw SVG
    tree diagrams from XSD files.
